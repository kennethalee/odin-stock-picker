# Stock Picker

## Overview
The Stock Picker program identifies the best days to buy and sell stocks to maximize profit. It processes stock prices and determines the most profitable buy-sell transaction.

## Features
- Calculates maximum profit from one buy-sell transaction.
- Identifies the best days to trade.
- Handles cases with no profit.
- Validates input for proper format.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Ruby Array Methods**: For efficient iteration.
- **Control Flow**: Manages exceptions.
- **Algorithm Development**: Optimized for performance.

## How It Works
1. Users input an array of stock prices.
2. The program identifies the lowest price to buy and the highest price to sell afterward.
3. It calculates and outputs the maximum profit and trade days.

## Example Usage
### Input:
```
Stock Prices: [17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10]
```

### Output:
```
[1, 4]
```

## Personal Thoughts
This program refined my Ruby and algorithm design skills. The biggest figuring out the logic, but solving edge cases was rewarding.
